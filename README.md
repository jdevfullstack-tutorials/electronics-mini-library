- Prototyping
    - A prototype is an early sample, model, or release of a product 
built to test a concept or process. It is a term used in a
variety of contexts, including semantics, design, electronics,
and software programming. A prototype is generally used to evaluate
a new design to enhance precision by system analysts and users.
Prototyping serves to provide specifications for a real, working 
system rather than a theoretical one.
