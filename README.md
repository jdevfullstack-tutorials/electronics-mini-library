- Prototyping
    - A prototype is an early sample, model, or release of a product 
built to test a concept or process. It is a term used in a
variety of contexts, including semantics, design, electronics,
and software programming. A prototype is generally used to evaluate
a new design to enhance precision by system analysts and users.
Prototyping serves to provide specifications for a real, working 
system rather than a theoretical one.

- Solderless Breadboard
    - Solderless breadboards make prototyping simple. Breadboards 
enables you to connect electronic components in thousands of ways 
to produce working circuits without soldering or damaging your 
circuit board â€” and you don't need additional tools. A breadboard 
is made up of formed metal sockets firmly secured in a durable 
plastic housing. The breadboard's grid pattern is a useful combination
of isolated tie points serving as discrete points in the circuit as 
well as a continuous bus structure that distributes
power and provides common ground points.

- Circuit Board
    - A circuit board is a physical piece of technology that allows
for the assembly of electrical or data circuits on a 
horizontal layer of material. Advances in circuit boards
have led to new engineering and 
manufacturing methods for these types of devices.

- Microcontroller
    - A microcontroller is an integrated circuit (IC) 
device used for controlling other portions of an electronic system,
usually via a microprocessor unit (MPU), memory, and 
some peripherals. These devices are optimized for embedded
applications that require both processing functionality
and agile, responsive interaction with digital,
analog, or electromechanical components.
