- Prototyping
    - A prototype is an early sample, model, or release of a product 
built to test a concept or process. It is a term used in a
variety of contexts, including semantics, design, electronics,
and software programming. A prototype is generally used to evaluate
a new design to enhance precision by system analysts and users.
Prototyping serves to provide specifications for a real, working 
system rather than a theoretical one.

- Solderless Breadboard
    - Solderless breadboards make prototyping simple. Breadboards 
enables you to connect electronic components in thousands of ways 
to produce working circuits without soldering or damaging your 
circuit board — and you don't need additional tools. A breadboard 
is made up of formed metal sockets firmly secured in a durable 
plastic housing. The breadboard's grid pattern is a useful combination
of isolated tie points serving as discrete points in the circuit as 
well as a continuous bus structure that distributes
power and provides common ground points.

- Circuit Board
    - A circuit board is a physical piece of technology that allows
for the assembly of electrical or data circuits on a 
horizontal layer of material. Advances in circuit boards
have led to new engineering and 
manufacturing methods for these types of devices.

- Microcontroller
    - A microcontroller is an integrated circuit (IC) 
device used for controlling other portions of an electronic system,
usually via a microprocessor unit (MPU), memory, and 
some peripherals. These devices are optimized for embedded
applications that require both processing functionality
and agile, responsive interaction with digital,
analog, or electromechanical components.

- Digital and Analog Signals 
    - An `analog signal` is time-varying and generally bound
to a range (e.g. +12V to -12V), but there is an infinite number
of values within that continuous range. An analog signal 
uses a given property of the medium to convey the signal’s
information, such as electricity moving through a wire. 
In an electrical signal, the voltage, current, or frequency of 
the signal may be varied to represent the information. Analog signals 
are often calculated responses to changes in light, sound,
temperature, position, pressure, or other physical phenomena.
A `digital signal` is a signal that represents 
data as a sequence of discrete values. A digital 
signal can only take on one value 
from a finite set of possible values at a given time.

- Transistor and Resistor
    - Transistor, semiconductor device for amplifying,
controlling, and generating electrical signals. Transistors 
are the active components of integrated circuits, 
or “microchips,” which often contain billions of 
these minuscule devices etched into their shiny 
surfaces. Deeply embedded in almost everything 
electronic, transistors have become the nerve 
cells of the Information Age.

- Series and Parallel Circuits
    - The basic idea of a “series” connection is that components are 
connected end-to-end in a line to form a 
single path through which current can flow.
The basic idea of a “parallel” connection, on the other hand, 
is that all components are connected across each other’s leads. 
In a purely parallel circuit, there are never more than two sets 
of electrically common points, no matter how many components 
are connected. There are many paths for current flow, 
but only one voltage across all components.

- Cathode and Anode
    - Cathode, negative terminal or electrode through 
which electrons enter a direct current load, such as an 
electrolytic cell or an electron tube, and the positive 
terminal of a battery or other source of electrical 
energy through which they return. This terminal corresponds
in electrochemistry to the terminal at which reduction occurs.
Within a gas discharge tube, electrons travel away from 
the cathode, but positive ions (current carriers)
travel toward the cathode.

    - Anode, the terminal or electrode from which electrons
leave a system. In a battery or other source of direct current 
the anode is the negative terminal, but in a passive load it is
the positive terminal. For example, in an electron tube electrons
from the cathode travel across the tube toward the anode, 
and in an electroplating cell negative ions 
are deposited at the anode.

- Schematic Diagram
    - A schematic, or schematic diagram, is a 
representation of the elements of a system using abstract,
graphic symbols rather than realistic pictures. A schematic
usually omits all details that are not relevant to the 
information the schematic is intended to convey, and 
may add unrealistic elements that aid comprehension...
In an electronic circuit diagram, the layout of the 
symbols may not resemble the layout in the circuit.

- Servomotor
    -  Servo motors (or servos) are self-contained 
electric devices that rotate or push parts 
of a machine with great precision.
